# Microsoft-Azure-VM
In this lab, I walked through the full process of deploying a virtual machine (VM) in Azure. I started from resource planning to secure remote access. The goal was simple: build a working cloud-hosted environment and understand each layer that makes it possible.  
# 🚀 Basic Lab: Create a Virtual Machine on Azure

### 📘 Overview
This lab demonstrates the end-to-end process of deploying a **Virtual Machine (VM)** in **Microsoft Azure** — from resource planning and configuration to secure remote access and cleanup.  
The goal was to gain foundational experience with **cloud infrastructure**, **networking**, and **system administration** — critical building blocks for my long-term journey toward becoming an **AI DevSecOps Purple Team Specialist**.

### 🧩 Objectives
- Deploy a cloud-hosted virtual machine in Azure.  
- Configure secure networking, compute resources, and user access.  
- Establish a remote connection (SSH/RDP) to manage the VM.  
- Practice responsible cloud resource management by cleaning up deployments.

### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
| Category | Skills |
|-----------|--------|
| ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** | Created and managed Azure Resource Groups, understood subscriptions and deployment models. |
| 💻 **Virtualization** | Deployed and configured Azure VMs using Ubuntu and Windows Server images. |
| 🌐 **Networking** | Set up Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, public IPs, and inbound port rules for secure remote access. |
| 🔐 **Access Management** | Established secure authentication with SSH keys (Linux) and RDP (Windows). |
| 🧰 **System Administration** | Connected to and managed OS environments remotely via CLI and GUI tools. |
| 💡 **Resource Management** | Cleaned up resources efficiently to avoid unnecessary billing. |
| 🧩 **Operational Awareness** | Learned the relationship between configuration, performance, and accessibility in cloud systems. |

### ⚙️ Steps Summary
1. **Create a Resource Group** in Azure (defines scope and region).  
2. **Deploy a Virtual Machine** using Azure’s VM creation wizard.  
3. **Configure Networking** — set up VNet, subnet, and inbound port rules (SSH/RDP).  
4. **Connect to the VM** securely via terminal (SSH) or Remote Desktop (RDP).  
5. **Validate & Test** — confirm connectivity and configuration.  
6. **Clean Up** — delete resources to prevent unnecessary cost.

### 🧭 Key Takeaway
> "Understand the infrastructure before you secure it."  
>   
> This lab reinforced how every component — from IP configuration to authentication — plays a role in the bigger cybersecurity and DevSecOps ecosystem. Building systems with clarity now ensures secure automation later.
